# No-Bullshit-Math-for-DS
I recently published a book on the mathematics of data science -- *No Bullshit Math for Data Science*. The book has two parts. Part I explores the core mathematics at use in data science. It dives deep into the nitty-gritty of key subjects like `Linear Algebra`, `Calculus`, `Statistics` and `Probability Theory`. Part II builds upon the knowledge gained in the first part and explores the underlying mathematics of some of the well-known machine learning algorithms and models, such as `Regression`, `Tree Methods`, `Support Vector Machines`, `Clustering`, `PCA`, and `Neural Networks`. The book also provides sample codes to implement each of the `algorithms` in `Python`.
